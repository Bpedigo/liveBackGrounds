===============

A program that lets you pick a built in windows screen saver and set it as your live wall paper. This isnt a real background but
a really blown up window that takes up the screen and fills it with the screen saver of your choice. To use your computer as normal
I suggest you press the windows key after the screen saver takes over the background this way you can still use your computer as 
normal. To see your real background press the windows key + D and your true background will be shown. I hope you enjoy this program!
